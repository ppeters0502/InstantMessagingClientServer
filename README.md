# InstantMessagingClientServer

### What is this project?
* It's part of the sprints that I need to complete for CSCI 3550 (Communication Networks) at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

### What are you trying to do?
* I'm trying to make a client-Server style instant messaging client in Java. The goal is to use multithreading (similar to what we've done in class) to make a server class that takes incoming messages from instances of a client class.

* I also want to work on my Object Oriented Design skills, so I plan on using some common design patterns such as factories and singleton patterns to improve the overall design of my code.

### How do I get run your project?
* Currently the project is a Netbeans project (I'm hoping to get builds setup on an external server soon). In the meantime, download the repository, import it into Netbeans, and you should be able to run the project from there.
